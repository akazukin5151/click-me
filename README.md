This is a handy tool that runs a cross platform simple http server on the program's current directory, and launches `http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.html` in the user's default browser

The http server binary is from https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server and the precompiled binaries are vendored in `http-server-vendor`

The binaries are currently version 0.6.1
